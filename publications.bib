title = "VRLOOP: Immersive Virtual Reality for Learning Object-Oriented Programming",
abstract = "Novice students often report difficulties applying abstract concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Several studies highlight the potential of Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) as a valuable tool for supporting classroom teaching through novel and engaging learning environments. However, combining interactive learning in VR with concepts from OOP is challenging. We present VRLOOP (VR Learning of OOP), an immersive system to learn OOP concepts in a collaborative and embodied environment. The design of VRLOOP combines principles from HCI and educational psychology. VRLOOP supports enactive rather than symbolic learning, i.e. the use of textual code. We conducted an initial pilot study with 14 students to evaluate VRLOOP's usability and gather subjective feedback. 93\% reported that VRLOOP made the content from the class easier to understand. Finally, we discuss limitations and directions for future research on VR environments for learning programming concepts.",
